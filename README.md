ðŸš€ Introducing My Latest Project: Students Performance Prediction(Math_score) System ðŸŽ“ðŸ“Š

I'm excited to share my recent work on a Students Performance Prediction System, a machine learning model designed to analyze student data and predict academic performance based on various factors, including:

Gender
Race/Ethnicity
Parental Level of Education
Lunch Type
Test Preparation Course Completion
Reading_score
Writing_score


This project leverages data analytics and machine learning to create actionable insights to make education more inclusive and effective. It's a step toward utilizing technology for better educational decision-making and enhancing learning outcomes.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python, pandas, sci-kit-learn, and data visualization tools, Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso,  RandomizedSearchCV, SVR, warnings, DecisionTreeRegressor,Pipeline

ðŸ“Š Impact: Helping educators understand the underlying factors affecting student performance.

ðŸ“šMy learning : XGBoost , Catboost , Data ingestion, Violin plot etc.

Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions for similar projects I can work on next! ðŸ˜Š
Letâ€™s connect and grow together! ðŸ™Œ
